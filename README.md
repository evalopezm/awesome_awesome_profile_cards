# AWESOME PROFILE CARDS
Second module team project for Adalab.

In this project we had to program a web app to create personalized business cards. The users should be able to add their professional data and get a design with this information. They also will be able to share this card with whoever they want and post it on Twitter. The webapp will store the data so the users don't need to add all of it every time they open it.
